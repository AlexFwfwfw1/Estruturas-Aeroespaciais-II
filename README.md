# Fuselage Composite Structural Analysis and Optimization

This project is a Composite Structural analysis of a fixed geometry aircraft tale using partial structural idealization. It's a university project from Aerospace Structures, usually made in Excel but extended in functionality and precision with a Python implementation. To mimic the Excel Solver capabilities, parametric and evolutionary algorithms are implemented from ground up for Composite Optimization.

## Description
The engine can:
- Calculate the equivalent charecteristics for a given set of composite compostition with a given set of composite materials and angles.
- Calculate section inertial and elastic paremeters.
- Using Structural Idealization methods and fault criterea, analyse fault points under a given safety factor.
- Calculate beanding and tortion.

The optimization algorithims implemented are:
- Parametric Study (Impratical due to a large number of degrees of freedom)
- Evolutionary Study (Pratical and activly used)
